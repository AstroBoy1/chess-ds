So either during the data collection process, I didn't get all the data and get it correctly, or while doing the analysis I messed up. Like maybe I was inner joining my users table and fact table inccorrectly. If I had left outer joined, maybe it could look more reasonsable if I had messed up getting the events for the users.

    "Chess has had a rich history since around c. 280, and some people thought chess has reached it’s peak, but computers have proved otherwise with the advent of AlphaZero. I love chess and wanted to see if I could answer some questions about chess using my data science toolkit. I used a standard data science architecture: scraping data using VMs into a SQLite database, exploring and cleaning it, analyzing and modeling the data, then creating visualizations and insight. With an iterative approach to the process.\n",

    "Some of the most interesting things I found in my opinion are that chess has been seeing an increase in popularity, but since 2004, it has not been as much as from 1991. As expected, about 80% of chess players are male, and all of the outreach has not done much to change this. There are more men who are better than chess at women. Largely in part, because there are more men than women. This does not suggest women are inherently worse than women at chess. Just that there is more variation among men because of the higher number of male players. Next time, I may try some significance testing for this. The average rating is about 800, which is to be expected. But it would be interesting too look at people who are active players, that way we get rid of people who aren’t serious about chess. New York, California, Texas, Illinois, and Florida are great places to live in for chess players. Which many people may have intuitively known already. But most people have probably not seen the map I made that shows chess popularity across all of the states.\n",

Overall, I may ask USCF for the complete picture, so all of their data, because I don't think I got quite all of the data. I can also try using outer joins instead of inner joins and see how things go. Lastly, I want to get the counts of the bins for when I created the histograms and match it up with the chess player rating categories like D, C, B, A, Expert, Master, etc. to explicitly get the number of chess players in each rating bin."
